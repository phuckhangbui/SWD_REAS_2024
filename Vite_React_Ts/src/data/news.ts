    newsContent: `New York judge on Friday ruled that Donald Trump, the nation's first real estate mogul turned U.S. president, will have to pay a $355 million fine for overvaluing his real estate empire and other assets.
  The former president was found liable for issuing false financial statements, falsifying business records, and conspiracy. He will be barred from leading a company in New York for three years. His sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. were fined $4 million each and can't run an organization in the state for two years.
  “They are accused only of inflating asset values to make more money,” Justice Arthur Engoron wrote in his decision. “The documents prove this over and over again.”`,

    newsTitle: "People should stop expecting real estate to become cheaper",

    newsContent: `Older generations had to wait decades for their properties to rise to the current prices, so younger generations should do the same instead of complaining about expensive real estate.
    I reside in a residential area in the Binh Duong Province, which is adjacent to Ho Chi Minh City’s Thu Duc City.
    
    It is a small neighborhood comprising several dozen houses where one can encounter dialects from all three regions of the nation.
    
    Migrant workers came to this area years ago to make a name for themselves, all the while living in cramped boarding houses.
    
    Now, everyone here has their own houses thanks to decades of hard work and saving, and a bit of luck.
    
    For instance, a couple selling groceries in my neighborhood was fortunate enough to have a house situated on a major road.
    
    They mentioned that about 15-20 years ago, the neighborhood was a poor area with no street lights and a road that was only wide enough for a motorcycle to pass through.
    
    At that time, they saved and borrowed an additional VND250 million (US$10,235) to purchase the plot of land. They only received a hand-written note confirming the transaction and were only able to secure an official land title much later.
    
    Now, they have a well-constructed and beautiful home.
    
    Last year, someone offered VND5 billion to buy the house for business purposes and the couple are considering selling it to move to another house on a smaller alley.
    
    I came here much later when the roads had already been developed and widened. By then the land price here had risen, but it was still affordable.
    
    I remember when I first moved here, the streets were so deserted that I always tried to return home before 9 p.m. due to fears of robbery.
    
    A few years later, many families came here to build houses, coffee shops and restaurants, making the area more bustling.
    
    Many people hope that house prices will decrease when the revised Land Law takes effect.
    
    I, however, do not share this view.
    
    The new law might stabilize real estate prices and curb speculation, but it definitely cannot reduce house prices as many people anticipate.
    
    And even when prices have stabilized, many people will compete to purchase homes and land, so properties near city centers will not be any easier to buy.
    
    Therefore, like the families in my neighborhood, if you cannot buy a house, you should purchase land in undeveloped and secluded areas like the city's outskirts and then wait for it to develop.
    
    Previous generations did so and waited for 15, 20 years or even half of their lives.
    
    So the current generation not being able to buy a house at a young age is not necessarily an unjust thing.
    
    So what is your viewpoint on this matter?`,

    newsContent: `Some VND120 trillion (US$4.8 billion) worth of bonds issued by real estate firms fall due this year, the highest level in five years, according to trading data provider FiinGroup.
    In its outlook for 2024, FiinRatings, the credit rating division of FiinGroup, said housing developers continue to face pressures with respect to liquidity, access to capital, interest rates, and recession.
    
    But those with good brands, guaranteed project quality, land plots with clear documents, and ability to execute projects could access a range of capital mobilization channels, and become resilient, it said.
    
    FiinRatings believed important legislation such as the newly passed amendments to the land, real estate businesses and housing laws would create a foundation for recovery, but warned new policies often take time to have an effect.
    
    Most developers have faced pressure to raise capital for their projects. Having to find options to refinance old debts at the same time has increased their risks.
    
    According to the Ministry of Construction, real estate supply continued to be limited in all segments last year.
    
    There were 52 completed housing projects with nearly 16,000 units, less than half the 2022 number, and 17 condotel projects, down 44%, it said.
    
    In the first three quarters transactions in the property market fell by 59% to 324,700`,

    newsContent: `Amendments to the Land Law that will take effect next year are set to make it easier for overseas Vietnamese to buy properties in the country.
    Overseas Vietnamese, or Viet Kieu, who do not have citizenship will get exactly the same rights as Vietnamese citizens when the changes take effect in 2025.
    
    The revised law will allow overseas Vietnamese to buy and rent houses that come with land, obtain land-use rights at housing projects and inherit residential and other types of lands adjoining houses.
    
    They can also directly buy and sell all types of properties instead of being limited to apartments and houses at housing projects, residential areas and urban area as they currently are.
    
    Nguyen Van Hau, vice president of the HCMC Bar Association, said the legal inability to buy certain kinds of properties and the complex procedures and documentation required to prove their Vietnamese origin caused many to buy in their relatives' names, leading to numerous disputes and lawsuits.
    
    Besides, many property developers are discouraged from selling houses to overseas Vietnamese as this requires approval from regulators.
    
    Hau believed the government would also simplify the process of proving one’s Vietnamese descent.
    
    At a seminar on buying houses by foreigners and overseas Vietnamese in 2023, Peter Hong, permanent vice chairman of the Business Association of Overseas Vietnamese, which represents Viet Kieu entrepreneurs, said many overseas Vietnamese want to settle down and invest in Vietnam but are unsure about property ownership.
    
    There are 5.5 million people of Vietnamese origin living abroad and another million with Vietnamese parents or grandparents.
    
    Over 20% of them are approaching retirement age and a majority of them wish to return to their roots in the final years of their lives, he said.
    
    Another survey by the HCMC Real Estate Club, a forum for real estate experts, found that three million Viet Kieu want to own property, especially in HCMC, when they settle down in Vietnam.`,
